How to enable private networking in DreamCompute
================================================

IAD2 has public networking available by default which means every one of your
servers gets allocated a public IP address when it is created on that network.
Some users may have the want for private networks, as they allow for a more
secure setup in some cases.

Enabling Private Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to enable private networking on your account in IAD2, you must submit
a request to support asking for it to be enabled. We don't currently have a way
to do it through the panel, but there are plans for that to be possible.

Price
~~~~~

Private networking in IAD2 will cost $5 per private network.
